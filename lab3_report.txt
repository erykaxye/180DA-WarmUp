What did you plan to do last week? 
- Attend lecture. 
- Finish up Lab 3. 
- Start working on slides for Midterm Presentation. 
What did you end up doing last week? 
- I set up the Raspberry Pi Zero and soldered the I2C pins on my BerryIMU. 
- I finished Lab 3, but my code classifies motions based on thresholds that I found, rather than learning the motion. 
 - My results are attached in forward_tilt.png and upward_motion.png. 
- I am looking into some Tensorflow tutorials for gesture recognition with the BerryIMU so that I can apply them to the project.  
- I started the slides for Midterm Presentation. They just need a little refinement and updates on progress.  
What do you plan to do this week? 
- I plan to be able to use Tensorflow (or some type of classifier) to detect 2 motions (tap, wave). 
- I plan to finish Lab 4.  
- I plan to attend lecture.
