What did you end up doing last week? 
- I finally got the correct Raspberry Pi Zero in the mail (it took over 4 weeks to ship). 
- My team discussed and turned in the Project Proposal with more a indepth schedule and defined roles. 
- I finished Lab 2, but instead of connecting between my teammates laptops, I set my Raspberry Pi as the subscriber and my laptop as the publisher. The screenshot of the result is attached (mqtt.png) with the python script output.
