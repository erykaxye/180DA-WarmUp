What did you plan to do last week? 
- Attend lecture. 
- Work on adding progress slides for Midterm Presentation. 
- Learn some basic Machine Learning and make some basic code that compiles. 
What did you end up doing last week? 
- I've decided to not use Tensorflow and instead used sklearns. I found a project at https://github.com/jewang/gesture-demo that I am trying to adapt for the BerryIMU. 
    - The Arduino she uses automatically calculates euler/quaternion values, so I am trying to figure out how to convert them with the BerryIMU values. 
- I added the slides for Midterm Presentation with some progress slides. 
What do you plan to do this week? 
- I plan to be able to use sklearns (or some type of classifier) to detect 2 motions (tap, wave). 
- I plan to attend lecture.
